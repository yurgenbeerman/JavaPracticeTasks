Hi!
I've completed my first task.

Here is folder structure for all my tasks: https://github.com/yurgenbeerman/JavaPracticeTasks
/src/package1 contais souces for the first task.

Please get local copy of the whole JavaPracticeTasks warehouse, modify c.cmd (to compile) and r.cmd (to run).

I will be grateful for all comments!
