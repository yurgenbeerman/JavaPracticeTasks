3. Anagram
Business-Logic Requirements:
An anagram is a word or a phrase that can be created by rearranging the letters of another given word or phrase. We ignore white spaces and letter case. The all letters of "Desperation" can be rearranged to the phrase "A Rope Ends It". The program should receive input of two strings and give the output to screen telling whether these words are anagrams


General requirements to applications are:
	•    Application must have accessible User Interface;
	•    Application must have foolproof (check of entering data);
	•    Application must be developed with minimum number of Java base classes – all the rest must be implemented autonomously. For example, Calendar Seeker can be easily implemented with the help of Date class but is very inappropriate in this module.
	•    Application with its interim releases must be placed in SVN repository. 
	•    When writing a code try to make it self-explanatory, but not confusing.
